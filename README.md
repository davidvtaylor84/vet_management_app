# Pardon the Interruftion

## This veterinary practice management app was built using:

* Python
* Flask
* PostGreSQL
* MongoDB

## Description
A stylish web app designed to help a veterinary practice manage their pet clientele. This app, made in seven days, has one-to-many relationships between client, pet and vet.

* Allows a user to search for client list based on pet name OR owner surname.
* Pet data, including treatment notes, saved to SQL database. Full CRUD functionality for the pets in the database.
* Displays the pets owned by each owner

## Extensions
I created a search bar using a SQL query that allows the user to search the database for an owner OR a pet by inputting their name.
